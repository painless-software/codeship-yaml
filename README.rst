Background
==========

Many continuous integration services support YAML configuration files in order
to support the `infrastructure as code`_ paradigm.  Codeship, though one of the
most appealing platforms, is missing this feature.  You have to add commands
regarding setup, testing and deployment in your Codeship project settings.
This has various disadvantages, but even though `users are complaining`_
Codeship is not planning to address the issue on its traditional build server
infrastructure.  (Only Codeship's new Docker-based infrastructure will finally
make you more happy.)

Usage
=====

Create a ``codeship.yml`` file in your repository at root level.  The syntax
is inspired by `Travis CI`_ and `Shippable`_, though only limited features are
supported.  Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   install:
     - pip install flake8
   before_script:
     - touch codeship-yaml-was-here
   script:
     - flake8
   after_success:
     - echo "Now we can deploy"

To make Codeship read and interpret your ``codeship.yml`` file, and execute
the commands in it add the following lines in the **Setup Commands** text box
at *Codeship* > *Select Project...* > *(your project)*, *Project Settings* >
*Test Settings*.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install codeship-yaml
   codeship-yaml

This will make ``codeship-yaml`` execute the commands you specified in the
default sections in the following section order:

#. ``install``
#. ``before_script``
#. ``script``
#. ``after_success``

More Control
------------

If you want more control over which sections are executed you can specify the
requested section as a parameter.  For example, you could add the following
commands into the below-mentioned text boxes of your Codeship project:

*Project Settings* > *Test Settings* > **Setup Commands**

.. code-block:: console

   pip install codeship-yaml
   codeship-yaml install

*Project Settings* > *Test Settings* > **Test Commands**

.. code-block:: console

   codeship-yaml before_script script

*Project Settings* > *Deployment* > **(branch name)**

.. code-block:: console

   codeship-yaml after_success

Adding custom sections, other than the default ones, to your ``codeship.yml``
file is possible but discouraged (to avoid losing similarity with other build
platforms).  If you want an additional section, which is established on other
platforms already, please consider placing a `pull request`_.

Python 3
========

The build image of Codeship Basic runs `Python 2.7 by default`_, but versions
3.4 through 3.7 are also installed. Codeship requires you to activate them
using ``pyenv``. Python is not Codeship's main expertise though, so expect a
bumpy ride. Activating Python versions could be made easier. Sad story.

To make all Python versions available in parallel add the following command
to the top of your *Project Settings* > **Setup Commands** on Codeship:

.. code-block:: console

    pyenv global 2.7 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7

Contribute
==========

For development we use `tox`_, which handles both static code analysis and
tests for all supported Python versions.

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install tox

After making your code changes don't forget to add tests, and simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ tox

When you place a `pull request`_ all tests are run on the build server
infrastructure of `Codeship`_, `Travis CI`_ and `Shippable`_ again. Please
check if they all pass to ensure the syntax stays compatible across the
different build infrastructures.

To remove all build files and folders including Python byte code you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ tox -e clean
